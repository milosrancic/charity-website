    <p>The Charity works directly with thousands of homeless people every year. We provide vital help so that people
      can rebuild their lives and are supported out of homelessness for good. We offer one to one support, advice and
      courses for homeless people in more than 17 European countries. How we help someone depends on their individual
      needs and situation. It could be with finding a home and settling in, getting new skills and finding a job, or
      help with their health and wellbeing. We use research to find out how best to improve our services, but also to
      find wider solutions to homelessness. Together with homeless people and Crisis suporters, we campaign for the
      changes needed to end homelessness for good.</p>
    <p>The Charity the power something globally, empowering communities to lift themselves out of poverty
      through holistic, sustainable international development model, the villages. The Charity is international and
      educational partner. Our organization is unique among European charities in that it operates collaborative
      programs both domestically and internationally.</p>
